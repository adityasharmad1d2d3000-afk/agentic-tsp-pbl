Agentic AI-based Hybrid Approach for the Travelling Salesman Problem

## Overview
This project explores the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using an Agentic AI-based hybrid optimization framework. The goal is to balance solution quality and execution time by orchestrating multiple optimization strategies.

## Algorithms Used
- Greedy (Nearest Neighbor)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Agentic Hybrid (Greedy initialization + GA refinement)

## Results
Simulation results compare tour length and execution time across different approaches. Bar graphs generated from Python simulations are included in this repository.

## How to Run
Run the main Python simulation script to reproduce the results.
